Study done using 1200 GeV 2018 T'+b -> t+H signal.
Plot the differences in jet mass against differences in NN top tagging score,
always taking "top minus Higgs". DeepAK8 seems to generally think a true Higgs
jet can look like a top jet while PN tends to only misfire for the (-30,0) area.

**Baseline (pages 1,5):**
Select top based on NN score + 105-210 GeV jet mass cut; remaining jet is the Higgs. If both jets pass top tag, take the one with the higher top tag score.

**Bad match (pages 2,6):**
Same as baseline but only events where the top and Higgs jets do not both match their respective generator particle.

**Good match (pages 3,7):**
Same as baseline but only events where the top and Higgs jets do both match their respective generator particle.

**Truth match (pages 3,7):**
Tag using the generator particles to identify each jet (requiring that both jets be matched to keep the event).|
